## About

tic-tac-toe is a coding challenge with the aim of evaluating knowledge and technical skills in web development areas specifically in technologies such as React / Redux and Express.

This repository is meant to be a learning resource working as a reference in your way to becoming a proficient web developer. It is not meant to let you copy and paste the solutions.

I encourage you to do the challenge on your own, write your own code that passes the tests, and consults this repository only if you truly have no idea how to do it or to check if there is perhaps a better, simpler or more efficient way of solving it.

Again, copying/pasting the solutions might let you cheat your way through, but it will not help you become a better developer. **The only person you will be cheating is yourself.**
